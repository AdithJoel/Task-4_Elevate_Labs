# Task-4_Elevate_LabsTask 4 – Firewall Setup and Usage
Description

This repository contains documentation and evidence for Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall. The task demonstrates basic firewall configuration and testing on Linux (UFW) and Windows (Windows Defender Firewall).

Objectives

Configure firewall rules to allow and block network traffic

Block insecure services (Telnet – Port 23)

Allow secure services (SSH – Port 22)

Test and verify firewall behavior

Restore firewall to original state

Tools Used

Linux: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Kali Linux

Windows: Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security

Testing: Netcat, PowerShell (Test-NetConnection)

 Summary

Firewall rules were successfully configured on both Linux and Windows systems. Telnet traffic on port 23 was blocked and verified through testing, while SSH traffic on port 22 was allowed for secure access. This task demonstrates how firewalls filter network traffic based on predefined rules to improve system security.
